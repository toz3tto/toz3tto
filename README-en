## 🧑‍💻 About Me

My name is **Luis Fernando Tosetto**, I'm from **Cascavel-PR**, and I'm **32 years old**.

---

## 🖥️ My Journey
  
- I'm an **IT technician**, but I graduated when I was young and couldn't get a job in the field. (I was very young, just **14 years old**.)

- I've **sold bus tickets**, worked in a **call center**, and worked in a **supermarket**. (I know, my place in heaven is already guaranteed. 😇)

- **I sold bus tickets**, and I got so good at it that I was promoted a few months later to work in the commercial area. 🚀

- **I greatly improved my communication skills and gained a lot of experience in the commercial field**, so I had the opportunity to **lead the commercial team** where I worked.

- Then came the **pandemic**, I lost my job and was unemployed for several months... and unfortunately, during this period, I also lost my mother.

- **I washed cars**, it was very hard to find a job during the pandemic, and this job helped me survive that period.

- While I was in college, I got a job in **support**, and three months later, I became a **developer**. (Imagine the fear! 😱)

- **I'm in the last year of college**, and I consider myself a **winner** just for having survived the journey. 💪

- If you've read this far, know that **God** is by your side at every moment of your journey, on the brightest days and in the darkest nights. You are never alone.
