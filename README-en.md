# 👋 Hello, welcome!!!

☕ **Grab a coffee**, come closer, and get to know a little about me.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

My name is **Luis Fernando Tosetto**, I'm from **Cascavel-PR**, and I'm **32 years old**.

---

## 🖥️ My Journey
  
- I am an **IT technician**, but I graduated when I was young and couldn't find a job in the field. (I was only **16 years old**!)

- I have **sold bus tickets**, worked in a **call center**, and in a **supermarket**. *(I know, my place in heaven is already guaranteed. 😇)*

- **I sold bus tickets** and got so good at it that, a few months later, I was promoted to work in the commercial department. 🚀

- **I greatly improved my communication skills and gained experience in the commercial area**, so I had the opportunity to **lead the commercial team** where I worked.

- Then came the **pandemic**, I lost my job and was unemployed for several months... and unfortunately, during this period, I also lost my mother.

- **I started washing cars**, it was very difficult to find a job during the pandemic, and this job helped me survive that period.

- While attending college, I got a job as **support staff**, and three months later, I became a **developer**. *(Imagine the fear! 😱)*

- **I am in my final year of college** and consider myself a **winner** just for having survived the journey. 💪

- If you have read this far, know that **God** is by your side at every moment of your journey – in the days of light and also in the darkest nights. **You are never alone.**

## 🌟 Inspiration

> "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
> He makes me lie down in green pastures.  
> He leads me beside still waters.  
> He restores my soul.  
> He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  
> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  
> I will fear no evil, for you are with me."  
> – **Psalm 23**
